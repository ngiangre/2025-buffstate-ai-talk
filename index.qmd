# Who am I?
- Nick Giangreco, PhD in Systems Biology  
- Data Scientist at Regeneron (Precision Medicine)  
- From academic research → industry impact  

# What are we talking about?
- Life as a data scientist in healthcare  
- Lessons from my PhD that still matter  
- How to get the most out of being a student  
- Why AI is a tool, not a threat  

# What to take away
- Data science = **impact through clarity**  
- PhD/grad school = **training for resilience**  
- AI = **amplifier of your skills**  

# Doing Data Science in Healthcare
- Problems are messy, urgent, and matter to patients  
- Example: integrating biomarker + clinical data for drug decisions  
- Success = code + communication + collaboration  

# Lessons from a PhD
- Ask sharp questions, not just clever ones  
- Stay resilient through setbacks  
- Learn how to learn fast  
- These skills transfer directly to industry  

# My Journey (stories here)
- Systems biology mindset → connecting messy data in pharma  
- Long projects in grad school → patience for clinical timelines  
- Collaborations in research → cross-functional teamwork in industry  

# Making the Most of Being a Student
- Time to explore broadly before narrowing focus  
- Build technical foundations now; specialization comes later  
- Relationships you form = future opportunities  

# Don’t Fear AI
- Use it to draft, code, summarize, ideate  
- Still need humans for framing + judgment  
- Those who embrace it wisely gain an edge  

# Closing
- PhD/student years: practice resilience, curiosity, adaptability  
- Industry: same skills, applied to higher stakes  
- Final message: use your student time to build skills + mindset for impact
