# Who am I?
- Nick Giangreco, PhD in Systems Biology @ Columbia
- Studied Biochemistry at University of Rochester
- Learned data science at the NIH and Columbia
- Currently a Data Scientist at Regeneron (Precision Medicine)  
   - I build data products to analyze biomarker data and streamline operations 

# Prelude
- My recovery from a brain injury taught me resilience 
- My resilience helped me excel in my PhD
- Be constructively critical of yourself - but know that you personally are amazing 

# What are we talking about today?

- Lessons from my PhD that still matter  
- How to get the most out of being a student  
- Why you should harness AI as a tool

# What to take away
- Data science = **impact through clarity**  
- PhD/grad school = **training for resilience**  
- AI = **Boost your productivity**  

# Doing Data Science at a Company
- At a company, you have deliverables, priorities, limited resources, and timelines
- Communicate the impact of your work - get used to making slides for your stakeholders
- Success = code + communication + collaboration  

# Lessons from a PhD
- Do internships
- Take advantage of being a student
   - Network!
