## This presentation is my perspective doing data science in industry

-   I really liked academia and doing biomedical data science research

    -   I was pretty OK at it too: \~ 12 papers with 6 as first author
    -   No LLMs at that time!

-   No one told me the difference between academic vs. industry work

-   There's some key lessons and insights that I wish I knew beforehand

-   I'd like to share **insights/tips** as an early-career data scientist

## This is an N=1, results may vary, perspectives are my own

## Tip 1 of 4: Making your work *transparent* can be **more important** than completing assigned work

-   You (and your team) are assigned work including dozens of projects

-   Stakeholders are consumers and producers of your work

-   Senior Leadership (SL) are consulted/informed for prioritization.

-   Managers/Directors are accountable to SL

-   If Managers/Directors can't communicate your work, how will SL know?

##

Give management your book of work with summaries so that the corporate machine keeps running

## Tip 2 of 4: Let your collaborators/stakeholders explore the data

##

This is an example for interactively examining interesting data points using Observable JS

```{ojs ojs_load_data}
data = FileAttachment("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/refs/heads/main/inst/extdata/penguins.csv").csv({ typed: true })
```

```{ojs ojs_filter_data}
//| panel: sidebar

viewof bill_length_min = Inputs.range(
  [32, 50], 
  {value: 35, step: 1, label: "Bill length (min):"}
)

viewof islands = Inputs.checkbox(
  ["Torgersen", "Biscoe", "Dream"], 
  { value: ["Torgersen", "Biscoe", "Dream"], 
    label: "Islands:"
  }
)

filtered = data.filter(function(penguin) {
  return bill_length_min < penguin.bill_length_mm &&
         islands.includes(penguin.island);
})
```

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Plot

```{ojs ojs_plot_data}

Plot.plot({
  inset: 8,
  grid: true,
  color: {
    legend: true,
  },
  marks: [
    Plot.dot(filtered, {x: "flipper_length_mm", y: "body_mass_g", stroke: "species"})
  ]
})
```

### Table

```{ojs ojs_filter_table}
Inputs.table(filtered)
```

This is an example for interactively examining interesting data points using R

```{r crosstalk}
library(crosstalk)
library(ggplot2)

# Wrap data frame in SharedData
dat <-
  dplyr::bind_rows(
    tibble::tibble(
      subject = paste0("Subject ",1:10),
      biomarker = rexp(10,rate = 1/5),
      disease = "stage 1"
    ),
    tibble::tibble(
      subject = paste0("Subject ",11:20),
      biomarker = rexp(10,rate = 1/7),

  widths = c(5,7)
)

## Tip 3 of 4 Always compare results of your complex models to simple, known, and understood models

-   Ensure your data science/analytics is interpretable!

## Tip 4 of 4: Learn how to use AI to make yourself more productive

-   At a company, you have deliverables, priorities, limited resources, and timelines
-   Leverage tools to make good use of available  resources

## Lessons from a former graduate student

-   Do internships
-   Take advantage of being a student
    -   Network!
    -   Learn as much as you can!
    -   Experience matters
-   Invest in your career
    -   Go to conferences
    -   Identify your domain
    -   Learn what energizes you

## Closing

-   Student years: practice resilience, curiosity, communication, and NETWORKING!
-   Industry: focus on communication and impact
-   Final message: use your student time to build skills + mindset for impact
